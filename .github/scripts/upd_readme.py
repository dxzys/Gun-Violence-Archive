## Statistics
>*Last updated: {last_updated}*
- **Total Incidents**: {total_incidents}
- **Incidents in {current_year}**: {incidents_this_year}
- **Most recent incident**: {most_recent_date} in {most_recent_location}
  - Casualties: {most_recent_deaths} killed, {most_recent_injuries} injured

# Framework
The Gun Violence Archive (GVA) provides public [reports](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports) of gun violence incidents in the U.S. (most notably mass shootings) that are downloadable in `.csv` format. Mass shootings (defined by GVA as incidents where 4+ people are shot, excluding the perpetrator) unfortunately happen far too often in the United States and are reported both in general *(Mass Shootings - All Years)* and by year *(Mass Shootings in 20xx)* as a result.

Because GVA's data is extensive and continuously updated, downloading all mass shooting incidents in a single file isn't easy. The site's "All Years" report only displays a limited number of the most recent incidents (up to 80 pages), so the corresponding CSV file is incomplete. Older incidents can only be obtained by downloading each yearly report separately and combining them manually.

This project cuts that work by maintaining an up-to-date "master" dataset of every mass shooting incident catalogued by GVA. It does this by checking for new incidents in the latest yearly report daily and automatically adding any data to the master dataset in this repository.

The project is entirely Python-based and relies on two scripts: 
- `gva.py` initiates the process and handles the data after the latest CSV is downloaded. After processing, new incidents are added to the master dataset (`master_gva.csv`).
- `export_gva.py` is called by gva.py. It automates the CSV downloading process using Selenium WebDriver. It dynamically constructs the correct URL for the current year's report (datetime) so that it automatically works for future years without needing manual updates.

Since no public API is available for GVA's reports, data is accessed in bulk by downloading CSV files directly from their website (hence why we need webdriver). This process is made more tedious as GVA generates dynamic export links with unique query identifiers, so we can't simply reuse a static download URL for a faster and more repetitive approach to downloading the data. Instead, we have to navigate the site and click the "Export CSV" button for each download. The exporter script locates this dynamic link by searching for "export-csv", located here (example below):
```html
<a href="/query/0484b316-f676-44bc-97ed-ecefeabae077/export-csv?year=2025" class="button">Export as CSV</a>
```
